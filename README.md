First push via git command lines, Starting to understand repositories.

Pushed this entire code from git command lines.

git init -- initialize a repository (hidden repo)(.git - hidden folder name), in my project folder/ working directory.

git status -- shows the status of the files (U - Untracked, A - Staging Area, (No letters) - no local repo/ already commit).

git add (git add (file name) - specific file, git add . - all file) -- adds to the staging area before on the local repository.

git commit -m 'Comment' -- after working directory, staging area, next is to commit to the local repository.

(Before you can push to the remote repository, You'll need the GitHub credentials and where repository folder to be added in the remote repository.)

git push -u (remote repository name (main)) -- push the files from local repo to remote repo (GitHub Acc) (-u (name) will be unnecessary once pushed on that repo for the first time).

(IF Update happens - backtrack to git add to move the update from working directory to the staging area, then commit, If finalized.)

More Commands such as..
git branch -m (old name) (new name) -- changes the branch name.

git check out (branch name) -- moves the user to that branch.
